ABSTRACT

Iris flower classification using Machine learning algorithm of support vector
classification method- The three types of Iris flowers which are Iris Versicolor, Iris Setosa,
Iris Virginica are classified based on their Sepal length, petal length, sepal width, petal
width. Dataset containing 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to the
different iris flower classification. The attributes like theÂ  Sepal length, petal length, sepal
width, petal width are given as input, our model would predict the type of Iris flower. Using
Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree classifier and Logistic Regression techniques, we
have done prediction for accuracy of the species of Iris flower.

PROBLEM DEFINITION

The iris flower is a distinctive genus of flowering plants. The scientific name for the
iris flower is Iris spp. Iris is a member of the Iridaceae family and has about 300 species.
Within this genus, there are three primary species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris
virginica.
These species exhibit variations in their physical characteristics, particularly in the
measurements of their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Most of these
species are found in temperate zones of the northern hemisphere, from Asia to Europe and
North America. The problem statement is to define the type of the iris flower from the
certain data given as input. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of
Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each
sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.

Key Project Details:

Iris flowers have three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
These species can be distinguished based on measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The project involves training a machine learning model on a dataset that contains iris flower measurements associated with their respective species.
The trained model will classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the mini project focuses on finding the accurate algorithm to classify
the iris flower based on the features given in the dataset we have successfully implemented
our system in Jupyter platform.
